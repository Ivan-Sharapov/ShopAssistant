     Inventory Management

        Automatically tracks product stock levels

        Persists data between program runs (saved in stock.txt)

        Prevents negative stock (cannot sell more than available)

     Financial Calculations

        Calculates the maximum purchasable quantity based on customer budget

        Fixed item price ($2 per unit)

        Automatically computes:

            Revenue from sales

            Tax (20% of revenue)

            Net profit

     Transaction Logging

        All sales are recorded in sales.txt with details:

            Date and time

            Quantity sold

            Remaining stock

            Financial breakdown (revenue, tax, profit)

     Feedback System

        Customers can rate the store (1-5 stars)

        Optional text feedback

        Inventory levels are saved in stock.txt

        Sales history and feedback are preserved after closing the program

 How It Works?

    Initialization

        The customer enters their budget in dollars and cents.

        The program checks current stock and displays the maximum purchasable quantity.

    Purchase Process

        The customer selects the desired quantity.

        If funds are insufficient, the system suggests a reduced quantity.

        After purchase:

            Stock levels are updated

            Sale details are logged

    Store Rating

        After checkout, the customer rates the store (1-5 stars).

        Optional text feedback can be provided.

    Data Storage

        All data is saved in files:

            stock.txt â€” Current inventory count

            sales.txt â€” Sales history with financial data

            feedback.txt â€” Customer ratings and reviews

 Technical Details

    Language: Python

    Data Storage: Text files (no database required)

    Encoding: UTF-8 (supports Cyrillic in reviews)

    Error Handling:

        Input validation (numbers only, valid ranges)

        Prevents negative stock

        Auto-recovery for corrupted files
